"I'm taking a course that covers probability theory, fundamental statistics, and practical Python applications for machine learning.
I'll learn about distributions, correlation, estimation, and inference, and work on hands-on tasks using tools like Jupyter Notebooks and Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib."
